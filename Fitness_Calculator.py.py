'''The BMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.

For example, if you weigh 70kg (around 11 stone) and are 1.70m (around 5 foot 7 inches)
tall, you work out your BMI by:

squaring your height in metres: 1.70 x 1.70 = 2.89
dividing your weight in kilograms: 70 √∑ 2.89 = 24.22
Your result will be displayed to one decimal place, for example, 24.2.'''

'''Sedentary (little or no exercise): TDEE = BMR √ó 1.2
Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week): TDEE = BMR √ó 1.375
Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week): TDEE = BMR √ó 1.55
Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week): TDEE = BMR √ó 1.725
Extra active (very hard exercise/sports & a physical job): TDEE = BMR √ó 1.9.
